## Bash Scripts
I have completely started from scratch, and have chosen to rebuild my script base.

I am trying a new technique where I just write scripts for my every day tasks and processes.

scripts:
 - automation-friendly:
    - `create-sudo-user-auto.sh` - A command line utility for quickly creating a sudo user
 - git-scripts:
    - `init-project.sh` - A script that initializes git for an existing project
 - install-scripts:
    - `install-docker.sh` - A script that installs docker
    - `install-homebrew.sh` - A script that installs homebrew
    - `install-node12.sh` - A script that installs Node 12 LTS
    - `install-the-basics.sh` - A script that installs a basic set of tools and common dependencies
    - `install-yarn.sh` - A script that installs yarn
 - setup-scripts:
    - `create-sudo-user.sh` - A script that creates a sudo user
    - `setup-apt.sh` - A script that configures apt after initial login
    - `setup-ols.sh` - A script that installs OpenLiteSpeed and configures it for usage
 - web-server-scripts:
    - `configure-certbot.sh` - A command line utility for installing and running certbot
